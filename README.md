## Overview
In this repository, you will find an implementation of a Machine Learning API that covers the following topics:

* Building a basic API with a single endpoint using the Flask microframework.
* Testing the API in different scenarios, including browser-based testing and tools like Postman.
* Consuming external and internal APIs using Postman and the Requests library in Python.
* Integrating pre-trained models and user-developed models.
* Utilizing serialization to ensure consistency of the models used in the API.
* Implementing basic authentication to protect API access.
* Deploying the application in various environments, including cloud servers.
* Managing dependencies using virtualenv and requirements.

## Development Environment
To run this project, you need to have the following development environment set up:

* Python 3.x: It is recommended to use the latest version of Python 3.
* Flask: The Flask microframework is used to build the API. You can install it using the pip package manager: pip install flask.
* Additional dependencies: If the API uses other specific libraries, they will be mentioned in the requirements.txt file in the repository.

Make sure to set up a virtual environment for the project to avoid conflicts with other Python dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the built-in venv tool in Python or use other popular tools like conda.

## Deepening
This repository provides an overview of Machine Learning API development. If you want to delve deeper into related topics, we recommend exploring other available resources, such as courses and documentation specifically focused on web development, Flask, HTTP verbs, API architectures, authentication, and more.
